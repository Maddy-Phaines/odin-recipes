    <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    <li>3 spring onions</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>200g pack large cooked prawns</li>

  <h3>Method</h3>

            <h4>STEP 1</h4>
            Tip the noodles into a large bowl and pour over a kettle of boiling water until they are covered. 
            Leave to stand for 5-10 mins until the noodles are soft, then drain well. 
            (You can do this part ahead of time – then just run the noodles under cold water until cool, 
            and toss through a little oil to stop them from sticking.) Next, mix together the tamarind paste, 
            fish sauce and sugar in a small bowl.

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            Peel and finely chop the garlic. Trim the ends off the spring onions and cut into thin slices about 1cm long.
            Heat a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. When it’s really hot (a drop of water should sizzle straight
            away), pour in the oil and swirl around. Tip in garlic and spring onions. To stir-fry, take a spatula or 
            tongs and toss the veg around the wok so they’re moving all the time. Cook for 30 secs, just until they begin
            to soften.

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok, then crack the egg into the centre. Keep stirring the egg for 30 
            secs until it begins to set and resembles a broken-up omelette.

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            Add the prawns and beansprouts, followed by the noodles, then pour over the fish sauce mixture. 
            Toss everything together and heat through. 
            Spoon out onto plates. Serve with some chopped peanuts sprinkled over and wedges of lime.
